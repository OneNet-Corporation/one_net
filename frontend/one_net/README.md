Absolutely! Below is a **complete, streamlined `README.md`** focused **only on the Flutter frontend** for `one_net`. This covers:

✅ How to install dependencies  
✅ How to start an **emulator** (Android & iOS)  
✅ How to run the project on the emulator  
✅ How to hot reload & common troubleshooting

# OneNet Flutter Frontend

## 📱 About
This is the **Flutter frontend** for the OneNet project. It uses:
- Flutter SDK (Dart)
- Provider for state management

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Make sure the following are installed:

✅ Flutter SDK - [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)  
✅ Android Studio (for Android emulators)  
✅ Xcode (for iOS simulators on macOS)  
✅ Device (Physical or Emulator) ready

# 🚀 Setup & Run

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd one_net/frontend/one_net
```

---

## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

---

## 3️⃣ Start Emulator (Android)

### Option 1: Use Android Studio
- Open **Android Studio**.
- Go to **Device Manager**.
- Launch an Emulator (e.g., Pixel 6, Pixel 7).

### Option 2: Start Emulator from Command Line
```bash
# List available AVDs (Android Virtual Devices)
emulator -list-avds

# Start the emulator (example for Pixel_6)
emulator -avd Pixel_6_API_34
```

---

## 4️⃣ Start Simulator (iOS - macOS only)

### Option 1: Use Xcode
- Open **Xcode**.
- Go to **Window > Devices and Simulators**.
- Start a Simulator (e.g., iPhone 16 Pro Max).

### Option 2: Start Simulator from Terminal
```bash
open -a Simulator
```

---

## 5️⃣ Run the Flutter Project
Once the emulator or simulator is running, run the app:

```bash
flutter devices                  # To see available devices
flutter run -d <device_id>       # Run on specific device
```

If you just want to auto-detect and run on the first available device:
```bash
flutter run
```

---

## 💨 Hot Reload
While the app is running, you can **hot reload** by pressing:

```bash
r
```

---

## 📦 Example Full Flow (Android Emulator)

```bash
cd one_net/frontend/one_net
flutter pub get
emulator -list-avds               # See available devices
emulator -avd Pixel_6_API_34       # Start emulator
flutter run                        # Run app
r                                  # Hot reload (after making changes)
```

---

## 📦 Example Full Flow (iOS Simulator on Mac)

```bash
cd one_net/frontend/one_net
flutter pub get
open -a Simulator                   # Open iOS simulator
flutter run -d "iPhone 16 Pro Max"  # Run app on the simulator
r                                   # Hot reload
```

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Emulator not found | Run `flutter devices` to check if the emulator is detected. If not, check your Android Studio AVD setup. |
| iOS simulator not found | Run `open -a Simulator` to start it manually. If that fails, ensure Xcode is installed. |
| Permissions issue | macOS may block running tools from the terminal. Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**, and allow Terminal permissions. |
| Hot reload not working | Make sure you ran `flutter run` from terminal and not from IDE if using command line. |

---

## 📚 Summary - Quick Commands

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install dependencies | `flutter pub get` |
| List devices | `flutter devices` |
| Start Android Emulator | `emulator -avd <avd_name>` |
| Start iOS Simulator (Mac) | `open -a Simulator` |
| Run on any available device | `flutter run` |
| Run on specific device | `flutter run -d <device_id>` |
| Hot reload | `r` (while running) |
